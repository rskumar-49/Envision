# Envisioner: A website for designing fictional Universes

## What the website is

The goal of this website is to give storytellers a way to neatly list aspects of their world.
The current features available are:
- Dashboard: navigate between different universes
- Maps: upload an image to serve as the map of your universe. You can then add pins for key locations.
- Sites: List key places within the universe
- Characters: List any participants in the story or universe
- Objects: List any important objects that may serve as key plot points
- Qualities: List other aspects of the Universe, such as religions or magic systems
- Misc: (**CURRENTLY WORK IN PROGRESS**)

## Current Bugs to be sorted:
- Refreshing a page of a universe will prompt the user to choose their universe again
- Submit buttons for various pages will dissapear after being pressed. They will return after the page is reloaded.
- Pins sometimes do not disappear
- (**I do not know how this was triggered**) really odd bug where it is impossible to give a new universe a name.

## Features to be implemented:
- Deleting names, fast facts
- Modifying names, fast facts
- Styling of the whole website!
  - ~~Wikipages~~
  - Maps
  - Universe Homepage/Misc

  - Dashboard
